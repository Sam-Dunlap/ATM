Simple ATM project

Practicing React's useState. This page will allow you to deposit and withdraw 'money' from your 'bank account'.
I adjusted the initial code by adding a dropdown menu to select an ATM mode. As long as no mode is selected, the input field is disabled. There is also verification in the form of not allowing you to withdraw greater than the total in your account, and not being able to deposit or withdraw negative amounts.
